Coloured flames Minetest mod by Shara RedCat which adds:

1. Ten decorative, non-destructive placeable fire types.
2. A fire starter tool to create them.

Note: This mod depends on abriglass and default in minetest_game.


Crafting
---------

To create coloured flames, first craft a fire starter tool using a steel ingot and a mese crystal fragment.

Place a node of coloured glass (non-patterned) from the abriglass mod.

While holding the tool, left click on top of the glass node. Coloured flame will appear. 

You can remove and replace the glass node with something else, and the flame will remain.
